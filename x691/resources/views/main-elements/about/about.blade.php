            CSCI X691 offers a hands-on learning experience for students in Dalhousie University, where they are placed
            in mixed-year groups to work on real client projects under the guidance of experienced professors and teaching
            assistants. The groups communicate directly with the clients to understand their expectations and provide
            deliverables. The students are responsible for managing the project and presenting the final product at the
            end of the semester. The project courses are open to non-profit client projects that require development
            work, weâ€™re always accepting new projects from clients willing to help our students learn!
